 ## *Usage Information*
  All you need to do is run 'node index' from the app's local directory, then answer the questions presented on command line and the app will do the rest! Please see the above walk-through video in the description section of this README file for a more detailed demonstration of its functionality.

  The easiest way to include a screen shot of your project in your generated README is to place the screen shot png image in the /src folder and name it screen-shot.png; which is the default name and location for the screenshot set in the app. If you do include a screen-shot in the generted readme, the file location will have to be updated to reflect the location of that file in your particular project.
