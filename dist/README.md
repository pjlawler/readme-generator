 ## *Description*
 ### This is my week 9 Node.js challenge submission. The task was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input utilizing the Inquirer npm package.

 ## *Usage Information*
  All you need to do is run 'node index' from the app's local directory, then answer the questions presented on command line and the app will do the rest! Please see the above walk-through video in the description section of this README file for a more detailed demonstration of its functionality.

  Adding a screenshot makes your README much more professional, but does add a little complexity to the process. If you do opt to include a screenshot of your project, the easiest way is to place the png image in the /src folder and name it 'screen-shot.png'; which is the default name and location for the screenshot in the app. You are able to use any location and filename for your screen shot, however, you will have to type it exactly for the app to locate that image on your system and include it in the final product.
  
  ***Please note*** - if you do want a screenshot to be included in your README.md file, the image you are using will have to be copied to your project along with the readme file.  Also, the url of that image in your project will have to be manually updated in your README file to reflect its location of your particular project. For example, if you have it in a './assets/imgs' folder for your project, you will need the readme to reflect the image's relative url to that location.
